                        Corporate loans can either be secured or unsecured. Secured loans demand a business asset as collateral as a part of security. If borrower apply for secured loans, he can benefit from a lower rate of interest, higher borrowing limits and longer repayment terms compared to unsecured loans. Actually secured loans are more better way to get maximum benefits in the deal compared to unsecured one.

Unsecured loans are applied for immediate fund requirements and no security is required. But, these unsecured loans requires high credit profile of customer.

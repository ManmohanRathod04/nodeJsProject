                        <p>Working capital is the difference between a company’s current assets and current liabilities. It is a financial measure, which calculates whether a company has enough liquid assets to pay its bills that will be due within a year. When a company has excess current assets, that amount can then be used to spend on its day-to-day operations.

                    <h1>Positive vs negative working capital</h1>
                    <p>Any person who is running a business with decent earning then business loan can be offered to that candidate. Several banks have different criteria, policy and terms which validate the authenticity of applicant’s business. After authentication and validation banks have authority to decide the amount of loan. </p>
                    <p>Having positive working capital can be a good sign of the short-term financial health of a company because it has enough liquid assets remaining to pay off short-term bills and to internally finance the growth of its business. With a working capital deficit, a company may have to borrow additional funds from a bank or turn to investment bankers to raise more money.
                    </p><p>
                        Negative working capital means assets aren’t being used effectively and a company may face a liquidity crisis. Even if a company has a lot invested in fixed assets, it will face financial and operating challenges if liabilities are due. This may lead to more borrowing, late payments to creditors and suppliers, and, as a result, a lower corporate credit rating for the company.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>Depending on the type of business, companies can have negative working capital and still do well. Examples are grocery stores like Walmart or fast-food chains like McDonald’s that can generate cash very quickly due to high inventory turnover rates and by receiving payment from customers in a matter of a few days. These companies need little working capital being kept on hand, as they can generate more in short order. </p>
                    <p>Products that are bought from suppliers are immediately sold to customers before the company has to pay the vendor or supplier. In contrast, capital-intensive companies that manufacture heavy equipment and machinery usually can’t raise cash quickly, as they sell their products on a long-term payment basis. If they can’t sell fast enough, cash won’t be available immediately during tough financial times, so having adequate working capital is essential.
                    </p>
